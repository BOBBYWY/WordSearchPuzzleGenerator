<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[About WSPG](https://github.com/KingOfTNT10/WordSearchPuzzleGenerator)

I started this project because belive it or not in school we had an assignment to do a search word puzzle but 
I didn't know if theres diagnoals in the puzzle so i was a bit frustrated, So I asked myself: "I could do that better"
Well first of all I hope i was right and second it wasn't easy, not at all... But I learnt a lot from that project
for example working with images etc.
and I'm very greatful for that
